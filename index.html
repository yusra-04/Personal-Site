      <p class="profile-description">I'm a student. I'm currently learning web dev. I've recently left my boring
         school, and shifted my focus into making my life. This is my personal
         site, and here I'll be sharing my progress.</p>

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p class="design-description">I started learning to code
          since I was 18 years old, because I wanted to make eye-catching
          websites. Over time, I gained a wealth of experience making
          UI/UX design websites, and since then I didn't stop learning more
          things one after the other.</p>

          <h3>Mobile & App Development</h3>
          <p  class="app-dev-description">Besides making websites and web
          applications, I also have my hands full with mobile and app
          development. My team & I have released quite a number of apps on App
          Store. So, it's safe to say that your stay on my
          personal site was worthwhile. Wasn't it? </p>

          <h3>Horse Racing</h3>
          <p class="horse-racing-description">I started this sport after I bought
          different breeds of horses, from stallions to mares, and built a stud
          farm near countryside of London. Yeah! You heard that right.</p>
